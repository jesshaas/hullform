# hullform
Hullform software by Blue Peter Marine Systems

The website is now defunct but before that happened the source code was released under the LGPL and the full binary professional versions were posted. The full ready to build linux source code was not posted but the sourcecode that was released contains ifdefs for linux and there is a linux release of the professional demo version which is a set of object files and a makefile which could be a handy start. This program is a bit long in the tooth but still being used by some but becoming hard to run on newer systems so someone may want to do a new build of it.
